### Challenges

- **Scope and requirements.**
  - As a user, it's easy to skip the details and focus on the outcome. This is essential, and the technical bits that came along with the implementation certainly made it challenging
    - Requirements were set for v1.0.0 in a document, where @papa, @markcarey and @cterio collaborated together to shape the direction of TOTH development.
    - We followed the: _given, when, then_ approach for settling the features that we will need for v1.0.0
    - The challenges that came up:
      - Technical refinement. There have been gray areas, such as signers, which required a bit of research time.
- **Backend and Database.**
  - Focusing on a scalable solution for v1.0.0 before moving onchain with v2.0.0
    - Vercel offers free databases, but with limited storage. We wanted something that would give us enough storage and ease of implementation and maintenance. I decided to choose MongoDB along with Node.js.
    - We currently deploy the BE on Heroku; different from where we deploy our frame (Vercel)
      - Eventually, we'll be using Next.js to offer a web version too, so we can have all the web front end, backend and frame in one repository and infra.
  - Linting and TypeScript setup issues. This only happened on the Backend, as the frame code was all setup nicely.
- **Next.js**
  - Having more React experience, Next.js was somehow easier to pick up. However, the build script posed some challenges with server rendering. This is definitely something on my list to improve upon.
- \*_Jest tests setup (unit and integration tests)_
  - Tests are essential to verify that your code is working as it should. However, sometimes it can delay your feature development, specially at initial stages.
  - I took a hybrid approach on TDD (test driven development), where not everything is fully tested, as there are things that were difficult to test, such as the signers flow onchain.
- **Manual testing.**
  - It was a bit tricky to test the nomination and voting flows, as they have their own timings for when it's possible to take an action. This is something on the radar to improve upon architecture-wise.
- **UI improvements.**
  - We received great feedback from FC users and devs. A common suggestion was to improve the user experience by increasing the font size and making it more readable. This is something that is on our radar, and we have new designs that will come before releasing v2.0.0
  - Fitting in information in a 1.91:1 frame is challenging, and having a designer at hand would have been fantastic.
- **Signers.**
  - @neynar are fantastic at providing documentation on how to create your own managed signers.
  - Despite this, the synchronisation between Neynar and our database posed a challenge which made it trickier to make this integration. Luckily, it's now solved and users can sign with no issues via the frame and TOTH website with either mobile or desktop.
- **Cannon script.**
  - This is the script that sends off the tips from users that have signed into TOTH.
  - The challenge was making sure that the cannon will fire to the right casts, as well as making sure we only fire off the approved signers.
